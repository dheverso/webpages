		Hi, I'm Hank Everson and I am a freshman studying civil engineering at North Carolina State University.
		Although I have not done my CODA process into civil engineering, I am striving to be accepted into the program after the summer semester of 2023.
		This major will allow me to pursue my passion for the engineering as well as being outside while on the job. 
		A career in the civil engineering industry is <ins>ultimately</ins> my goal!
		</p>    
		<br/>
		<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px; color: #400300; text-align: center">
		My dream job would be to be a <strong>travelling</strong> chief civil engineer. 
		This job would allow me to spend more time outdoors while overlooking all of the company jobs.
		Ideally, I would be given a company work-truck to drive around each job site to make sure procedures are running as they should.
		<em>Although</em>, once I start a family, I would need to not travel as much so settling down in one place would be perfect for me!
		</p>
